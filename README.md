# Professional-Portfolio

## Task Description

 The task was to create a professional portfolio with different HTML and CSS elements that we learned in class. The webpage was created entirely from scratch and the purpose is to utilize items such as flexbox and CSS variables to present a skeletal outline for a webpage that could potentially be used to garner attention during a job search process.
